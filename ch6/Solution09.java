	 * 1.A door n is toggled once for each factor of n,including itself and 1.For example,door 9 is toggled on 
	 *   rounds 1,3,and 9
	 * 2.A door is left open if the number of factor is odd.Because every two factors regard as an open and a close.
	 *   If there is one remaining,the door will be open.
	 * 3.The value x is odd if n is a perfect square.For example,
	 *   if n is 25,then factors are (1,25),(5,5).And (5,5)only contributes one factor,
	 *   thus n has an odd number of factors.
	 * 4.There are 10 squares:1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100.
	 * Therefore,there are 10 lockers open at the end of this process.
