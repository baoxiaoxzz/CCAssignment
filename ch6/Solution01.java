/*
 * We know the expected weight of a bunch of pills.The difference between the expected weight 
 * and the actual weight will indicate which bottle contributed the heavier pills,provided we 
 * select a different number of pills from each bottle.
 * So we can take one pill from Bottle 1,two pills from Bottle 2,three pills from Bottle 3,
 * and so on.Weigh this mix of pills .If all pills were one gram each,the scale would read 210
 * grams(1+2+3+...+20)=20*21/2=210).Any "overage" must come from the extra 0.1 gram pills.
 * The formula is : (weight - 210)/0.1  .
 * So,if the set of pills weighed 211.8 grams,then Bottle 18 would have the heavy pills.
