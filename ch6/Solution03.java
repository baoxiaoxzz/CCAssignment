	 * It is impossible.
	 * The chessboard initially has 32 black and 32 white squares.By removing
	 * opposite corners(which must be the same color),we are left with 30 of one color
	 * and 32 of the other color.We can assume that we have 30 black and 32 white squares.
	 * Each domino we set on the board will always take up one white and one black square.
	 * Therefore,31 dominos will take up 31 white squares and 31 black squares exactly.
	 * However,on this board,we only have 30 black squares and 32 white squares.
	 * Hence,it is impossible.
